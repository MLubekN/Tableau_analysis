**Seattle Airbnb project:**

Project aim was to assess where and when it is best to rent out an Airbnb in Seattle based on renting data from 2016.
From the analysis we can assume that the most rentable Airbnb's are with 1 bedroom, but their price is the lowest thus resulting in small revenue per rent.
Moreover we can see that the most suitable time to rent an Airbnb in Seattle is in summer holiday season and at the end of the year.
